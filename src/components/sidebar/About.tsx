      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack developer with a focus on building functional applications.
        My knowledge spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to work on projects across the entire stack.
        I have experience with DevOps practices and I enjoy experimenting with infrastructure in my personal homelab setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for technology and problem solving. 
        I continuously seek opportunities to learn and create solutions. 
        My curiosity and approach to learning has driven me to explore new tools and technologies, 
        both professionally and in my personal projects.
