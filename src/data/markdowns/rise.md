## Building a Inventory Management Solution for Hogent
For Hogent's nursing course, we developed a inventory management system designed to simplify reserving equipment and keeping track of consumable goods. This project involved creating a webpage, a reservation system, and a Product Management System (PMS) - all interconnected through a shared database.

## A Webpage for Seamless Management and Reservation
The core for management of the system is the webpage, designed to provide a smooth and intuitive experience for users. The front-end was built using Blazor and ASP.NET. On the back-end, we used .NET core and Entity Framework, which offers robust performance. This combination allows users to effortlessly browse products, place reservations, and interact with the system in real-time.

## Admin Functionality

The webpage also contains admin functionality, such as viewing history of actions performed on the system. The adding, editing and removing of products or changing the stock amount needed for small corrections. Lastly the management of users and their privileges within the system.

## Mobile side

For the client we also developed an android application to help users to smoothly view or check out products, and for Inventory managers to add stock of products by scanning barcodes.

## Delivering Value
The ultimate goal of this project was to provide Hogent with a streamlined platform that simplifies their processes. Inventory managers can quickly scan and update stock, while users benefit from efficient reservation and check out processing, and administrators ar able to manage everything from one source. By integrating these components into a single, cohesive system, weâ€™ve created a solution that enables fluid operation between staff and students on campus.
