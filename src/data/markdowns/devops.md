## Building a Order Management Solution for SVK
For SVK, a producer and distributor of roof and facade cladding, we developed an Order Management System designed to simplify the management of orders and insurance pictures. This project involved creating a webpage, a android app, and an Order Management System (OMS) - all interconnected through a shared database.

## A Webpage for Seamless Management
The core for management of the images is the webpage, designed to provide a smooth and intuitive experience for users. The front-end was built using Blazor and ASP.NET. On the back-end, we used .NET core and Entity Framework, which offers robust performance. This combination allows users to effortlessly browse orders and images, and interact with the system in real-time.

## Admin Functionality

The webpage allows to view orders and attached insurance images, for quick access in case of problems with delivered orders.

## Mobile side

For the client we also developed an android application to help users to smoothly find orders and view or add images.

## Delivering Value
The ultimate goal of this project was to provide SVK with a streamlined platform that simplifies their processes. Users can quickly find orders and view images. By integrating these components into a single, cohesive system, weâ€™ve created a solution that enables fluid operation between office staff and warehouse staff.
