# School Project: Personal frontend project

## Simple project for my courses Frontend and Backend Development
The goal of this project was to showcase my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, best practices and techniques. This project involved creating a webpage and a Rest api back-end connected to a database.

## Idea
The objective was to showcase our skills of what we learned, we were encouraged to keep the project either personal or ask people near to us if they needed a web solution for a current problem. The idea originated from one of the free API's proposed during the first class of the course, [super hero api](https://superheroapi.com/). This api and the stats that it returned for each specific hero reminded me of a card game from my youth (Top Trumps). So it was planned to simulate the experience of that game but with the data from superheroes/villains from multiple fandoms. But due time constraints of other course works, I wasn't able to fully implement all extra functionality (those outside what was required to fulfill the course requirements).

## Card Management
Admins are fully able to manage, add or remove hero data via the admin panel. User's are abel to manage their own cards and group cards into teams, these teams would then later have been able to be used to battle simple bots so the user could earn more cards. The more cards the user collects the better team composition would be.
