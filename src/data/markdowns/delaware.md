## Building a B2B E-Commerce Solution for Delaware
For Delaware, we developed a tailored Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce solution designed to streamline operations for both buyers and sellers. This project involved creating a webshop frontpage, an Order Management System (OMS), and a Product Management System (PMS) – all interconnected through a shared database.

## A Webshop for Seamless Ordering
At the heart of this solution is the webshop, designed to provide a smooth and intuitive ordering experience for businesses. The front-end was built using Vite + React, ensuring a fast and responsive user interface. On the back-end, we used the NestJS framework, which offers scalability and robust performance. This combination allows businesses to effortlessly browse products, place orders, and interact with the system in real-time.

## Order Management System

Processing orders efficiently is vital for any e-commerce platform, and that’s where the Order Management System (OMS) comes in. Built in Java with a JavaFX GUI, the OMS provides sellers with the tools they need to process, track, and manage orders. From order confirmation to fulfillment, every step is streamlined to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy.

## Easy Product Management for Sellers

Managing products is just as important as processing orders. The Product Management System (PMS), also developed in Java with a JavaFX GUI, allows sellers to easily update product details, manage inventory levels, and ensure their offerings are always up to date. With this system, sellers have full control over their product catalog, enabling them to adapt quickly to changing market demands.

## Delivering Value to Businesses
The ultimate goal of this project was to provide businesses with a streamlined platform that simplifies their operations. Buyers can place orders with ease through the webshop, while sellers benefit from efficient order processing and robust product management tools. By integrating these components into a single, cohesive system, we’ve created a solution that supports both sides of the B2B equation.
