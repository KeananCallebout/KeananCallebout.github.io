      "summary": "This school project for Delaware involved creating a Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce solution with three integrated components. The webshop frontpage was developed using Vite + React for the front-end and NestJS for the back-end, allowing businesses to browse products and place orders online. The Order Management System (OMS), built in Java with a JavaFX GUI, handles the processing, tracking, and management of these orders. Additionally, the Product Management System (PMS), also developed in Java with a JavaFX GUI, enables sellers to manage product details and inventory. All three components share a common database to ensure seamless integration and real-time synchronization. The project’s goal was to provide businesses with a streamlined platform to place orders through the webshop, process them efficiently in the OMS, and allow sellers to manage products through the PMS.",
